Keras is a high-level neural network API. It supports us to do quick-test, 
which means we can have our ideas tested immediately.
Keras would be a good choice when we have these kinds of need:

1.Modular, simple to have a runnable prototype.

2.Support CNN and RNN, or combined.

3.Able to switch between CPU & GPU.


-----------------------------------


Technology and Platform used for development
1.Coding languages: Python. 
Keras is designed and aimed for its friendly using style. 
Python is such a language that is very comfortable to write. 
So I believe that python would be best choice no matter python is 
not as fast as C++ when it comes to performance comparison.

2.Build system & build tools environment needed: None.
Keras is capable with any python IDE.

3.Frameworks / libraries used in the project: Numpy,CNTK,Tensorflow...


-----------------------------------


Testing
Travis CI as their testing platform. 
They have code coverage metrics for example:https://coveralls.io/github/phreeza/keras, 
to ensure its meaningful.
