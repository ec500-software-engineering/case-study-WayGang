Keras-case-study

Technology and Platform used for development
1.Coding languages: Python. 
Keras is designed and aimed for its friendly using style. Python is such a language that is very comfortable to write. So I believe that python would be best choice no matter python is not as fast as C++ when it comes to performance comparison.

2.Build system & build tools environment needed: None.
Keras is capable with any python IDE.

3.Frameworks / libraries used in the project: Numpy,CNTK,Tensorflow...

Testing
Travis CI as their testing platform. 
They have code coverage metrics for example:https://coveralls.io/github/phreeza/keras, to ensure its meaningful.
